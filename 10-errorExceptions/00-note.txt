Errors and exceptions
    -- try, catch the errors and exceptions to avoid code to break.

Types of Errors:
    -- syntax : parsing errors
    -- exceptions : Errors detected during execution are called exceptions
        e.g. ZeroDivisionError, NameError and TypeError.
    -- It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.
