Multi-Threading
    -- understand threading concepts to write mutli-threaded applications.

Thread : The smallest unit that can be scheduled in an operating system.
    -- normally created by a fork of a computer script or program in two or more parallel
    -- usually contained in processes.
    -- share the code or instructions and the values of variables of a process.
Types :
    Kernel threads
    User-space Threads or user threads

Every process has at least one thread, i.e. the process itself.
A process can start multiple threads.
The operating system executes these threads like parallel "processes".
