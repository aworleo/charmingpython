# When should I use python
    -- proof of concepts implementations where "this works!" is important
    -- quickly develop and deliver
    -- performance is not a prime concern (for now)
    -- leisure projects for fun
    -- experimenting stuff which is additional activity
    -- there are too many unknowns, community comes to rescue

# Why
    -- free and open source
    -- Python reads like English
    -- Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features
    -- The larger a community, the more likely you'd get help
    -- The more useful projects there are, the more likely someone has already built a function you need
    -- On Angel List, Python is the 2nd most demanded skill and also the skill with the highest average salary offered.
